# 3-Floor Company

Enterprise Multi-Floor Network Simulation

Project Overview

This project simulates a scalable and secure enterprise network spanning three floors, designed to optimize traffic segmentation, security, and performance.

Network Architecture

3 Floors – Each floor has 3 VLANs for structured network segmentation.

3 Cisco Routers & 3 Managed Switches – Ensuring efficient traffic flow and redundancy.

Access Points – Wireless connectivity for each LAN.


Implemented Technologies & Configurations

Routing: OSPF (Optimized Path Selection)

Switching & VLANs: VLAN, VTP, Inter-VLAN Routing, STP (Loop Prevention)

Security Measures:

Port Security (Prevents unauthorized access)

DHCP Snooping (Prevents rogue DHCP attacks)

SSH (Encrypted remote management)


Network Services: DHCP (Dynamic IP allocation), DNS


Tools & Platforms

Cisco Packet Tracer 

Cisco Routers & Switches

Networking Best Practices


How to Use

1. Open the .pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer.


2. Review configurations using show running-config on routers and switches.


3. Test network connectivity using ping and traceroute commands.
